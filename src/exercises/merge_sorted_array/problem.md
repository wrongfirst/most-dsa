You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, both sorted in **non-decreasing order**, along with two integers `m` and `n`, where:

- `m` is the number of valid elements in `nums1`,

- `n` is the number of elements in `nums2`.

The array `nums1` has a total length of `(m+n)`, with the first `m` elements containing the values to be merged, and the last `n` elements set to `0` as placeholders.

Your task is to merge the two arrays such that the final merged array is also sorted in **non-decreasing order** and stored entirely within `nums1`.
You must modify nums1 in-place and do not return anything from the function.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums1 = [10,20,20,40,0,0], m = 4, nums2 = [1,2], n = 2

Output: [1,2,10,20,20,40]
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums1 = [0,0], m = 0, nums2 = [1,2], n = 2

Output: [1,2]
```

**Constraints:**
* `0 <= m, n <= 200`
* `1 <= (m + n) <= 200`
* `nums1.length == (m + n)`
* `nums2.length == n`
* `-1,000,000,000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1,000,000,000`
