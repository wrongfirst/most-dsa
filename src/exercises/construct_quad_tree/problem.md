Given a `n * n` matrix `grid` of `0's` and `1's` only. We want to represent `grid` with a Quad-Tree.

Return *the root of the Quad-Tree representing* `grid`.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

- `val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. Notice that you can assign the `val` to True or False when `isLeaf` is False, and both are accepted in the answer.

- `isLeaf`: True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children.

```java
class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
```

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

1. If the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.

2. If the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to False and set `val` to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.

3. Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.

**Quad-Tree format:**

You don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list `[isLeaf, val]`.

If the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is True we represent it as `1` in the list `[isLeaf, val]` and if the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is False we represent it as `0`.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]

Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
```

Explanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:
Notice that 0 represents False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]

Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
```

Explanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.
The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.
The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.

**Constraints:**
* `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`
* `n == 2ˣ` where `0 <= x <= 6`
