You are given the `head` of a **singly linked list** and two integers `left` and `right` where `left <= right`, reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right` (**1-indexed**), and return the reversed list.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 1, right = 3

Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: head = [1,1], left = 1, right = 1

Output: [1,1]
```

**Constraints:**
* The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
* `1 <= n <= 500`.
* `-500 <= Node.val <= 500`
* `1 <= left <= right <= n`

**Follow up:** Could you do it in one pass?
