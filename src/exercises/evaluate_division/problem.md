You are given an array of variable pairs `equations` and an array of real numbers `values`, where `equations[i] = [Ai, Bi]` and `values[i]` represent the equation `Ai / Bi = values[i]`. Each `Ai` or `Bi` is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some `queries`, where `queries[j] = [Cj, Dj]` represents the `jth` query where you must find the answer for `Cj / Dj = ?`.

Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return `-1.0`.

**Note:** The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

**Note:** The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["ab","bc"]], values = [4.0,1.0,3.25], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["c","c"],["ab","a"],["d","d"]]

Output: [4.00000,0.25000,1.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"]]

Output: [0.50000,2.00000]
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= equations.length, queries.length <= 20`
* `equations[i].length == queries[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= Ai.length, Bi.length, Cj.length, Dj.length <= 5`
* `values.length == equations.length`
* `0.0 < values[i] <= 20.0`
* `Ai, Bi, Cj, Dj` consist of lower case English letters and digits.
