You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, and you are allowed to traverse between its indices. You can traverse between index `i` and index `j`, `i != j`, if and only if `gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1`, where `gcd` is the **greatest common divisor**.

Your task is to determine if for every pair of indices `i` and `j` in `nums`, where `i < j`, there exists a **sequence of traversals** that can take us from `i to j`.

Return `true` if it is possible to traverse between all such pairs of indices, or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [4,3,12]

Output: true
```

Explanation: There exists three possible pairsof indices. For each pair, the sequence of traversals are:
- (0,1) -> [0,2,1]
- (0,2) -> [0,2]
- (1,2) -> [1,2]

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [2,3,7]

Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= nums.length <= 100,000`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 100,000`
