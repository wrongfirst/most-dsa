You are given an array of length `n` which was originally sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with **distinct** values). It has now been **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6]` might become:

* `[3,4,5,6,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
* `[1,2,3,4,5,6]` if it was rotated `6` times.

Given the rotated sorted array `nums` and an integer `target`, return `true` if `target` is in `nums`, or `false` if it is not present.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [3,4,4,5,6,1,2,2], target = 1

Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [3,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 4

Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
* `-10,000 <= target, nums[i] <= 10,000`
* `nums` is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
