You are given a string `s` and a dictionary of words `dictionary`. You have to break `s` into one or more **non-overlapping** substrings such that each substring is present in `dictionary`. There may be some **extra characters** in `s` which are not present in any of the substrings.

Return the **minimum** number of extra characters left over if you break up `s` optimally.

**Note** that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: s = "neetcodes", dictionary = ["neet","code","neetcode"]

Output: 1
```

Explanation: The optimal way is to break `s` into two substrings: "neet" from index 0 to 3 and "code" from index 4 to 7. There is one character which is at index 8.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: s = "neetcodde", dictionary = ["neet","code","neetcode"]

Output: 5
```

Explanation: The optimal way is to break `s` into one substring: "neet" from index 0 to 3. The characters at indices from 4 to 8 are extra.

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= s.length <= 50`
* `1 <= dictionary.length <= 50`
* `1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 50`
* `s` and `dictionary[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters
* `dictionary` contains distinct words
