Alice and Bob are playing a game with piles of stones. There are an **even** number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`.

The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. The total number of stones across all the piles is **odd**, so there are no ties.

Alice and Bob take turns, with **Alice starting first**. Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones either from the **beginning** or from the **end** of the row. This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the **most stones wins**.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return `true` if Alice wins the game, or `false` if Bob wins.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: piles = [1,2,3,1]

Output: true
```

Explanation: Alice takes first pile, then Bob takes the last pile, then Alice takes the pile from the end and Bob takes the last remaining pile. Alice's score is 1 + 3 = 4. Bob's score is 1 + 2 = 3.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: piles = [2,1]

Output: true
```

**Constraints:**
* `2 <= piles.length <= 500`
* `piles.length` is **even**.
* `1 <= piles[i] <= 500`
* `sum(piles[i])` is **odd**.
