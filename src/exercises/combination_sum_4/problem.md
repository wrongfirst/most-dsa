You are given an array of **distinct** integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, return the number of possible combinations that add up to `target`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [3,1,2], target = 4

Output: 7
```

Explanation: The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [1], target = 3

Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
* `1 <= nums[i], target <= 1000`
* All the elements of `nums` are **unique**.

**Follow up:** What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?
