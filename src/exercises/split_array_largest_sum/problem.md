You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, split `nums` into `k` **non-empty** subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray is **minimized**.

Return the minimized largest sum of the split.

A **subarray** is a contiguous part of the array.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [2,4,10,1,5], k = 2

Output: 16
```

Explanation: The best way is to split into `[2,4,10]` and `[1,5]`, where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 16.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [1,0,2,3,5], k = 4

Output: 5
```

Explanation: The best way is to split into `[1]`, `[0,2]`, `[3]` and `[5]`, where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 5.

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 1,000,000`
* `1 <= k <= min(50, nums.length)`
