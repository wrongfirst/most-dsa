You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the **top-left** corner (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right** corner (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * (10^9)`.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,0]]

Output: 3
```

Explanation: There are three ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right -> Down
3. Down -> Right -> Right -> Down

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,0]]

Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**
* `m == obstacleGrid.length`
* `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`
* `obstacleGrid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
