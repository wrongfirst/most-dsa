You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the **minimal length** of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return `0` instead.

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: target = 10, nums = [2,1,5,1,5,3]

Output: 3
```

Explanation: The subarray `[5,1,5]` has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: target = 5, nums = [1,2,1]

Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= nums.length <= 100,000`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10,000`
* `1 <= target <= 1,000,000,000`

**Follow up:** If you have figured out the `O(n)` solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is `O(n log(n))`.
