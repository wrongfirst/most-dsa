You are given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], k = 4

Output: [5,6,7,8,1,2,3,4]
```

Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [8,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [7,8,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [6,7,8,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 4 steps to the right: [5,6,7,8,1,2,3,4]

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [1000,2,4,-3], k = 2

Output: [4,-3,1000,2]
```

Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [-3,1000,2,4]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [4,-3,1000,2]

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= nums.length <= 100,000`
* `-(2^31) <= nums[i] <= ((2^31)-1)`
* `0 <= k <= 100,000`
