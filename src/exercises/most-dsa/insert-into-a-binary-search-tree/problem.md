You are given the `root` node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value `val` to insert into the tree. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is **guaranteed** that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

Note: There may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return any of them.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: root = [5,3,9,1,4], val = 6

Output: [5,3,9,1,4,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: root = [5,3,6,null,4,null,10,null,null,7], val = 9

Output: [5,3,6,null,4,null,10,null,null,7,null,null,9]
```


**Constraints:**
* `0 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 10,000`.
* `-100,000,000 <= val, Node.val <= 100,000,000`
* All the values `Node.val` are unique.
* It's **guaranteed** that `val` does not exist in the original BST.
