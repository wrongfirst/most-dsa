The **XOR** total of an array is defined as the bitwise `XOR` of all its elements, or `0` if the array is **empty**.

- For example, the **XOR total** of the array `[2,5,6]` is `2 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 1`.

You are given an array `nums`, return the **sum** of all **XOR totals** for every **subset** of `nums`. 

Note: Subsets with the `same` elements should be counted multiple times.

An array `a` is a **subset** of an array `b` if `a` can be obtained from `b` by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of `b`.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [2,4]

Output: 12
```

Explanation: The four subsets of [2,4] are
1. The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.
2. [2] has an XOR total of 2.
3. [4] has an XOR total of 4.
4. [2,4] has an XOR total of (2 XOR 4 = 6).
The sum of all XOR totals is 0 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 12.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: [3,1,1]

Output: 12
```

Explanation: The eight subsets of [3,1,1] are
1. The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.
2. [3] has an XOR total of 3.
3. [1] has an XOR total of 1.
4. [1] has an XOR total of 1.
5. [3,1] has an XOR total of (3 XOR 1 = 2).
6. [3,1] has an XOR total of (3 XOR 1 = 2).
7. [1,1] has an XOR total of (1 XOR 1 = 0).
8. [3,1,1] has an XOR total of (3 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 3).
The sum of all XOR totals is 0 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 3 = 12.

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= nums.length <= 12`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 20`
