You are given a positive integer `k`. You are also given:

- a `2D` integer array `rowConditions` of size `n` where `rowConditions[i] = [above[i], below[i]]`, and
- a `2D` integer array `colConditions` of size `m` where `colConditions[i] = [left[i], right[i]]`.

The two arrays contain integers from `1` to `k`.

You have to build a `k x k` matrix that contains each of the numbers from `1` to `k` **exactly once**. The remaining cells should have the value `0`.

The matrix should also satisfy the following conditions:

- The number `above[i]` should appear in a **row** that is strictly **above** the row at which the number `below[i]` appears for all `i` from `0` to `n - 1`.

- The number `left[i]` should appear in a **column** that is strictly **left** of the column at which the number `right[i]` appears for all `i` from `0` to `m - 1`.

Return **any** matrix that satisfies the conditions. If no answer exists, return an empty matrix.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[2,1],[1,3]], colConditions = [[3,1],[2,3]]

Output: [[2,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,3,0]]
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[2,3]], colConditions = [[2,1]]

Output: []
```


**Constraints:**
* `2 <= k <= 400`
* `1 <= rowConditions.length, colConditions.length <= 10,000`
* `rowConditions[i].length == colConditions[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= above[i], below[i], left[i], right[i] <= k`
* `above[i] != below[i]`
* `left[i] != right[i]`
