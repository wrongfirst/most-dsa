You have a lock with `4` circular wheels. Each wheel has `10` slots: `'0'`, `'1'`, `'2'`, `'3'`, `'4'`, `'5'`, `'6'`, `'7'`, `'8'`, `'9'`. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn `'9'` to be `'0'`, or `'0'` to be `'9'`. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.

The lock initially starts at `'0000'`, a string representing the state of the `4` wheels.

You are given a list of `deadends` dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.

Given a `target` representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the **minimum** total number of turns required to open the lock, or `-1` if it is impossible.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: deadends = ["1111","0120","2020","3333"], target = "5555"

Output: 20
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: deadends = ["4443","4445","4434","4454","4344","4544","3444","5444"], target = "4444"

Output: -1
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= deadends.length <= 500`
* `deadends[i].length == 4`
* `target.length == 4`
* `target` **will not be** in the list `deadends`.
* `target` and `deadends[i]` consist of digits only.
