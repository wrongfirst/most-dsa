You are given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, add spaces in `s` to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences in **any order**.

**Note** that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: s = "neetcode", wordDict = ["neet","code"]

Output: ["neet code"]
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: s = "racecariscar", wordDict = ["racecar","race","car","is"]

Output: ["racecar is car","race car is car"]
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: s = "catsincars", wordDict = ["cats","cat","sin","in","car"]

Output: []
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= s.length <= 20`
* `1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 10`
* `s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.
* All the strings of `wordDict` are **unique**.
* Input is generated in a way that the length of the answer doesn't exceed 100,000.
