A string `s` is called **happy** if it satisfies the following conditions:

- `s` only contains the letters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.
- `s` does not contain any of `"aaa"`, `"bbb"`, or `"ccc"` as a **substring**.
- `s` contains at most `a` occurrences of the letter `'a'`.
- `s` contains at most `b` occurrences of the letter `'b'`.
- `s` contains at most `c` occurrences of the letter `'c'`.

You are given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the **longest possible happy** string. If there are multiple longest happy strings, return any of them. If there is no such string, return the empty string `""`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.


**Example 1:**

```java
Input: a = 3, b = 4, c = 2

Output: "bababcabc"
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: a = 0, b = 1, c = 5

Output: "ccbcc"
```

**Constraints:**
* `0 <= a, b, c <= 100`
* `a + b + c > 0`
