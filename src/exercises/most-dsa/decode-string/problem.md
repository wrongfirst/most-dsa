You are given an encoded string `s`, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times. Note that `k` is guaranteed to be a **positive integer**.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. There will not be input like `3a`, `2[4]`, `a[a]` or `a[2]`.

The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed `100,000`.


**Example 1:**

```java
Input: s = "2[a3[b]]c"

Output: "abbbabbbc"
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: s = "axb3[z]4[c]"

Output: "axbzzzcccc"
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: s = "ab2[c]3[d]1[x]"

Output: "abccdddx"
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= s.length <= 30`
* `s` is made up of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets `'[]'`.
* All the integers in `s` are in the range `[1, 300]`.
* `s` is guaranteed to be a valid input.
