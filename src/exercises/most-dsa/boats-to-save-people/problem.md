You are given an integer array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `ith` person, and an **infinite number of boats** where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries **at most** two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return the **minimum** number of boats to carry every given person.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: people = [5,1,4,2], limit = 6

Output: 2
```

Explanation:
First boat `[5,1]`.
Second boat `[4,2]`.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: people = [1,3,2,3,2], limit = 3

Output: 4
```

Explanation:
First boat `[3]`.
Second boat `[3]`.
Third boat `[1,2]`.
Fourth boat `[2]`.

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= people.length <= 50,000`
* `1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 30,000`
