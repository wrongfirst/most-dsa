In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different `order`. The `order` of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of `words` written in the alien language, and the `order` of the alphabets, return `true` if and only if the given words are **sorted lexicographically** in this alien language.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: words = ["dag","disk","dog"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"

Output: true
```

Explanation: The first character of the strings are same ('d'). 'a', 'i', 'o' follows the given ordering, which makes the given strings follow the sorted lexicographical order.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: words = ["neetcode","neet"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"

Output: false
```

Explanation: The first 4 characters of both the strings match. But size of "neet" is less than that of "neetcode", so "neet" should come before "neetcode".

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= words.length <= 100`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
* `order.length == 26`
* All characters in `words[i]` and `order` are English lowercase letters.
