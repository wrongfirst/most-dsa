You are given `heights`, a `2D` array of size `rows x columns`, where `heights[row][col]` represents the height of cell `(row, col)`. You are situated in the top-left cell, `(0, 0)`, and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, `(rows-1, columns-1)` (i.e., **0-indexed**). You can move **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**, and you wish to find a route that requires the **minimum effort**.

A route's **effort** is the **maximum absolute difference** in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return the **minimum effort** required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.



**Example 1:**

```java
Input: heights = [
    [1,1,1],
    [3,2,4],
    [2,5,4]
]

Output: 2
```

Explanation: The route of `[1,1,2,4,4]` has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: heights = [
    [1,1,1],
    [1,1,2],
    [6,5,2]
]

Output: 1
```

Explanation: The route of `[1,1,1,1,1,2,2]` has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells.

**Constraints:**
* `row == heights.length`
* `col == heights[i].length`
* `1 <= row, col <= 100`
* `1 <= heights[i][j].length <= 1,000,000` .
