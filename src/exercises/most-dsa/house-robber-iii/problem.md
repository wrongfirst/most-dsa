The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called `root`.

In this new place, there are houses and each house has its only one parent house. All houses in this place form a **binary tree**. It will automatically contact the police if **two directly-linked houses were broken**.

You are given the `root` of the binary tree, return the **maximum** amount of money the thief can rob **without alerting the police**.

Output: 12
```

Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 1 + 4 + 2 + 5 = 12
