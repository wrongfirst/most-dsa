A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within `days` days.

The `ith` package on the conveyor belt has a weight of `weights[i]`. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by `weights`). It is not allowed to load weight more than the **maximum weight capacity** of the ship.

Return the **least weight capacity** of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within `days` days.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: weights = [2,4,6,1,3,10], days = 4

Output: 10
```

Explanation:
1st day: [2]
2nd day: [4,6]
3rd day: [1,3]
4th day: [10]

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5], days = 5

Output: 5
```

Explanation:
1st day: [1]
2nd day: [2]
3rd day: [3]
4th day: [4]
5th day: [5]

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: weights = [1,5,4,4,2,3], days = 3

Output: 8
```

Explanation:
1st day = [1,5]
2nd day = [4,4]
3rd day = [2,3]

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= days, weights.length <= 50,000`
* `1 <= weights[i] <= 500`
