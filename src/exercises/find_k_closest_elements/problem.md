You are given a sorted integer array `arr`, two integers `k` and `x`, return the `k` closest integers to `x` in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order.

An integer `a` is closer to `x` than an integer `b` if:

- `|a - x| < |b - x|`, or
- `|a - x| == |b - x|` and `a < b`

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: arr = [2,4,5,8], k = 2, x = 6

Output: [4,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: arr = [2,3,4], k = 3, x = 1

Output: [2,3,4]
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= k <= arr.length <= 10,000`.
* `-10,000 <= arr[i], x <= 10,000`
* `arr` is sorted in **ascending** order.
