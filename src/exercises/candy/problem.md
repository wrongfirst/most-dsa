There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the **minimum** number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: ratings = [4,3,5]

Output: 5
```

Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: ratings = [2,3,3]

Output: 4
```

Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= ratings.length <= 20,000`
* `0 <= ratings[i] <= 20,000`
