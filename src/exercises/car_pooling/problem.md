There is a car with `capacity` empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

You are given the integer `capacity` and a integer array `trips` where `trips[i] = [numPassengers[i], from[i], to[i]]` indicates that the `ith` trip has `numPassengers[i]` passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are `from[i]` and `to[i]` respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.

Return `true` if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: trips = [[4,1,2],[3,2,4]], capacity = 4

Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: trips = [[2,1,3],[3,2,4]], capacity = 4

Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= trips.length <= 1000`
* `trips[i].length == 3`
* `1 <= numPassengers[i] <= 100`
* `0 <= from[i] < to[i] <= 1000`
* `1 <= capacity <= 100,000`
