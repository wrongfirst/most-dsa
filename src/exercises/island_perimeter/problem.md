You are given a `row x col` `grid` representing a map where `grid[i][j] = 1` represents land and `grid[i][j] = 0` represents water.

Grid cells are connected **horizontally/vertically** (not diagonally). The `grid` is completely surrounded by water, and there is **exactly one island** (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length `1`.

Return the **perimeter** of the island.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: grid = [
    [1,1,0,0],
    [1,0,0,0],
    [1,1,1,0],
    [0,0,1,1]
]

Output: 18
```

Explanation: The perimeter is the 18 red stripes shown in the image above.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: grid = [[1,0]]

Output: 4
```

**Constraints:**
* `row == grid.length`
* `col == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= row, col <= 100`
* `grid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
* There is exactly one island in `grid`.
