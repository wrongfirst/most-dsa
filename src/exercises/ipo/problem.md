A company has limited resources, it can only finish at most `k` distinct projects before the IPO. Help the company to design the best way to **maximize** its total capital after finishing at most `k` distinct projects.

You are given `n` projects where the `ith` project has a pure profit `profits[i]` and a minimum capital of `capital[i]` is needed to start it. Initially, you have `w` capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list of at most `k` distinct projects from given projects to **maximize** your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,4,2,3], capital = [0,3,1,1]

Output: 8
```

Explanation : The order of indices to pick are [0,3,1] and final capital is (1 + 3 + 4) = 8.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: k = 4, w = 2, profit = [2,3,1,5,3], capital = [4,4,2,3,3]

Output: 14
```

Explanation: The order of indices to pick are [2,3,4,1] and final capital is (2 + (1 + 5 + 3 + 3)) = 14.

**Constraints:**
* `n == profits.length == capital.length`
* `1 <= n, k <= 100,000`
* `0 <= w <= 1,000,000,000`
* `0 <= profits[i] <= 10,000`
* `0 <= capital[i] <= 1,000,000,000`
