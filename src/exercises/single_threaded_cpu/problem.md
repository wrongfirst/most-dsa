You are given `n` tasks labeled from `0` to `n - 1` represented by a 2D integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i] = [enqueueTimei, processingTimei]` means that the `ith` task will be available to process at `enqueueTime[i]` and will take `processingTime[i]` to finish processing.

You have a single-threaded CPU that can process at most one task at a time and will act in the following way:

- If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks to process, the CPU remains idle.

- If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the one with the **shortest processing time**. If multiple tasks have the same shortest processing time, it will choose the task with the **smallest index**.

- Once a task is started to process, the CPU will process the entire task without stopping.

- The CPU can finish a task then start a new one instantly.

Return the order in which the CPU will process the tasks.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: tasks = [[1,4],[3,3],[2,1]]

Output: [0,2,1]
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: tasks = [[5,2],[4,4],[4,1],[2,1],[3,3]]

Output: [3,4,2,0,1]
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= tasks.length <= 100,000`
* `1 <= enqueueTime[i], processingTime[i] <= 1,000,000,000`
