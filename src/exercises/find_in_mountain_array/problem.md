(This problem is an **interactive problem**.)

An array `arr` is called a **mountain array** if and only if:

- `arr.length >= 3`
- There exists some index `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
    - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
    - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

You are given a mountain array `mountainArr` and an integer `target`, return the **minimum** index such that `mountainArr.get(index) == target`. If such an `index` does not exist, return `-1`.

You cannot access the mountain array directly. You may only access the array using a `MountainArray` interface:

- `MountainArray.get(k)` returns the element of the array at index `k` (0-indexed).
- `MountainArray.length()` returns the length of the array.

You can only make **at most** `100` calls to the function `get()`. Submissions making more than `100` calls will be judged as **Wrong Answer**. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: mountainArr = [2,4,5,2,1], target = 2

Output: 0
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: mountainArr = [1,2,3,4,2,1], target = 6

Output: -1
```

**Constraints:**
* `3 <= mountainArr.length() <= 10,000`
* `0 <= target, mountainArr.get(index) <= 1,000,000,000`
