Alice and Bob are playing a game with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array `stoneValue`.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take `1`, `2`, or `3` stones from the **first** remaining stones in the row.

The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is `0` initially.

The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.

Return `"Alice"` if Alice will win, `"Bob"` if Bob will win, or `"Tie"` if they will end the game with the same score.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: stoneValue = [2,4,3,1]

Output: "Alice"
```

Explanation: In first move, Alice will pick the first three stones (2,4,3) and in the second move Bob will pick the last remaining stone (1). The final score of Alice is (2 + 4 + 3 = 9) which is greater than the Bob's score (1).

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: stoneValue = [1,2,1,5]

Output: "Bob"
```

Explanation: In first move, Alice will pick the first three stones (1,2,1) and in the second move Bob will pick the last remaining stone (5). The final score of Alice is (1 + 2 + 1 = 4) which is lesser than the Bob's score (5).

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: stoneValue = [5,-3,3,5]

Output: "Tie"
```

Explanation: In first move, Alice will pick the first three stones (5,-3,3) and in the second move Bob will pick the last remaining stone (5). The final score of Alice is (5 + -3 + 3 = 5) which is equal to the Bob's score (5).

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= stoneValue.length <= 50,000`
* `-1000 <= stoneValue[i] <= 1000`
